Black Hole/Atomic City (State of Decay) slated to open at the Sanitary Tortilla Factory on August 2, 2019, is an
exhibition dedicated to alternative stories related to “the nuclear business” in New Mexico since the dawn of the
Anthropocene/Trinity test near Tularosa in July 1945. The combined burden of nuclear byproducts and waste that decays
over tens of thousands of years weighs heavily on New Mexico, a “national sacrifice zone.” The show will be on view
until August 30.

              Impacts that largely affect Indigenous and rural communities from nuclear weapons and their production in New Mexico and
              around the world, are not featured in the celebratory story of the Atomic Age promoted by Los Alamos, set for the
              commemoration in 2020 of the 75th Anniversary of the Trinity Test and the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the first
              and only cities to be destroyed with atomic weapons.

  This will be one of numerous efforts to highlight alternative views of our nuclear world during the lead up to the
  Anniversary of the Nuclear Age. The Black Hole, a Los Alamos business known world-wide for recycling equipment and
  materials from the Los Alamos Scientific/National Laboratory, was owned by anti-nuclear activist Edward Grothus, who
  died in 2009. Artist and activist Barbara Grothus is the lead organizer of the project.
  As we face the twin debacles of climate crisis and nuclear proliferation, both human made and life-threatening, the
  need
  for dialog and action are urgent, and we are grateful for this opportunity. Please contact Barbara Grothus for further
  information at bhatomiccity@gmail.com or 505-235-9529.

                </h4>
                <p class="card-text">THINGS come together, some of sentimental value, some carry the past, sometimes my past, sometimes
                pasts of other people, places known by me and not known at all, objects that have a history with me, others
                in various states of wear when we meet. Something of the object brings us together.
                My work is with photography and video, found photographs, alternative photographic processes, and
                objects I collect and ceramic objects I make.
                This work fits within a larger, ongoing body of work, loosely called I am going to get rid of all this stuff, and
                the focus is on transience and the fluidity of identity.
                Recent bodies of work are personally transitional in that they mark my move from the UK back to my
                hometown of Taos. Can I ever leave my adopted home? Can I ever really come back to Taos, after 50
                years?

        moved to the USA. The history and geography of the USA and Japan influence her work. After the Fukushima nuclear

        her hometown became the candidate to be the final disposal site for radioactive waste. She’s visited nuclear facilities
        and polluted areas to investigate global nuclear issues. International disputes, environmental issues, borders,
        discrimination, identity, media literacy, self-transformation, and all those connections are motivations for her work.</p>
